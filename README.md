Java Bytecode Manipulator
===============

### This project is no longer maintained

If you look at the commit dates you'll see that it has been a while since this library has been updated.
Unfortunately it was never finished, but if you're looking for a non-Java library for parsing JVM class files,
I'd recommend you checkout my latest project, [jvm.js](https://github.com/kylestev/jvm.js), which allows you
to parse and perform static analysis on JVM class files. It's not feature-complete just yet, but is much further
along than this project and holds a promising future.

This library is for parsing and manipulating Java classfiles similar to the Bytecode Engineering Library https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bcel/

This is for manipulating Java classfiles with ease and without having the overhead of the JVM.
